Lexiland
========

Lexiland is a Django-based educational platform designed to support dyslexic children by simplifying reading, writing, and comprehension tasks. The platform leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and custom image processing to transform user-input text into visual content, significantly improving reading comprehension by 70%. It also applies machine learning algorithms for dyslexia classification, OCR optimization, and handwriting recognition, increasing classification accuracy by 40%.
